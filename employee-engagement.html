  <h2>Employee Engagement in the Maritime Industry</h2>
</div>
  <div class="col-md-7">
    <br><br>
    <p>The maritime industry is widely dispersed, with actual owners in one country,
commercial administrators in another, crew managers in a third while the ship itself is
always on the move. In addition, the industry has many departments such as
Commercial, Technical, Operations, Crewing and the ship, which have their own
organizational structure, leadership styles, work groups, and so on. And all these
divisions and subdivisions have to work together to ensure organizational profitability
and effectiveness. While operating, they face various challenges thanks to international
conventions and the laws of many countries. As those divisions have to make a large
number of decisions on the spot, they can effectively contribute to a company’s
profitability only when the Mariners and crew members are properly engaged.
Now the question arises, what does the word ‘engaged’ refer to? Here, it implies to the
Employee Engagement, which is a multi-dimensional concept. It can be defined as an
extent to which an employee feels passionate for his or her job. It relates to employees’
satisfaction and their commitment to an organization. Employee engagement as a
paradigm has been widely upheld in recent times in the shipping industry as it has
shown correlations with productivity, profitability, safety, employee turnover,
absenteeism, and so on. Moreover, an engaged employee will not have to be coaxed to
put in an effort to take an initiative, meet organizational needs, or support and reinforce
values and cultures. Instead, such an employee will be vigilant and focused and will
know that he or she can make a difference to an outcome.
Working in the maritime industry demands high emotional and physical labor and gives
seafarers little time to rest. Under such strenuous conditions, if an employee is not
engaged, it can lead to disasters such as the Cosco Busan.<br><br>
On 7 November 2007, at 8:00 hours, a fully loaded 900-foot container ship, Cosco
Busan, headed for South Korea. She slipped her berth in San Francisco harbor. On the
San Francisco Bay Bridge, there was the Pilot, Master, Third Officer, and helmsman.
The crew on the ship were new to each other, new to the ship, as well as new to San
Francisco. They had joined the ship after the change of ship’s ownership. A company
port Captain, superintendent engineer, and chief engineer supervised their work and
<br><br>
operations. The Pilot, who was on duty at Cosco Busan’s con, had 26 years’ experience
of navigating the San Francisco Bay waters. Before steering the big ship, he had
already checked the winds and tides. He also tuned the radars and set them to the
range he liked to work with. Unfortunately, around 08:30, Cosco Busan crashed into
Delta Tower of the Bay Bridge. It ripped a gash 212 feet long, 10 feet high, and 8 feet
deep along its port side, rupturing and bursting ballast and bunker oil tanks. To assess
the damage of the collision with support tower, the Pilot decided to take the ship to an
anchorage that was two miles beyond the bridge. Along the way, Cosco Busan leaked
53,000 gallons of fuel oil into the bay, which affected 26 miles of shoreline. It also
caused the death of 3,000 birds from 50 species. The final cost for the environmental
clean-up was estimated at US$70 million. The investigating team found that the pilot
had taken a cocktail of 10 prescription drugs. As a result, he was not capable to make
the correct decisions for navigation.<br><br><br><br>
This incident worked as an eye-opener. Many types of research and studies were
conducted. They showed that when employees were engaged, they fully absorbed in
their work. And, they exerted extra effort towards their organization’s success. They
took more interest in the well-being of their organization and were enthusiastic about
their work. This helped them to take proactive and positive actions to further the
organization’s reputation and interests.<br><br>
Employee engagement can help to avoid many unwanted events from occurring. Some
of the many benefits of employee engagement in the maritime industry are listed below.
Employee Satisfaction: According to various researches, if employees are engaged in
their work or in their organization, the level of their job satisfaction increases.
Employees who are engaged and satisfied are very devoted to the success of the
organization and have a high level of loyalty and commitment. They promote and
support the company’s strategy, mission, and brand.<br><br>
Productivity: Engaged employees are often top performers. To achieve success, they
are committed to going the extra mile. It means the more engaged employees are, the
more efficient and success-driven they become, which certainly leads to an increase in
motivation and productivity.<br><br><br><br>

Innovation: There is a close relationship between employee engagement and
innovation. And if employees are engaged, they perform at a higher level. This results in
bringing passion and interest to their job, which often leads to innovation in the
workplace. Highly engaged employees develop a sense of ownership in their
organizations by which they tend to constantly think of innovative methods to improve
themselves and their teams.<br><br>
Profitability: Those companies who have a greater number of engaged employees
tend to have higher profitability rates. Several studies and researches have proven that
when employees are engaged, they become more efficient and productive, positively
affecting the company’s outcome. A study suggests that companies that have highly
engaged employees generate 26% higher revenue per employee. Employee
engagement leads to more efficiency and productivity of employees resulting in lesser
operating costs and an increase in the profit margin.<br><br>
It is, thus, not difficult to realize that when employees are fully engaged and immersed
in their work, they can achieve astounding results. It is therefore imperative that
employee engagement is taken more seriously because it leads to improved
performance and elicits the power of employees working together for a common goal.</p>
