    <p>Maritime accidents cause severe damage to the environment and property, affecting both human
and marine environments. Despite the availability of modern bridge equipment, new
technologies, and advanced safety measures, maritime accidents still occur. Of course, there are
many reasons for disasters such as mechanical failures, adverse weather conditions, and traffic
density, but human factor attributes to a majority of those accidents. It thus becomes imperative
to capture and analyze the human factor to take preventive measures to safeguard life, property,
and the environment at sea. Predictive data analytics can help in extensively reduce the number
of maritime accidents.</p>
<p><strong>Case Study:</strong></p>
<p>
The importance of capturing human factor analytics can be understood by the following
example. A few years ago, an electrical contractor in Alberta used predictive analytics software
to improve their company’s safety performance. In a few years, the company found that
employee participation in identifying risks had increased, and as a result, the number of
unwanted incidents had reduced. The employees started identifying 10,000 to 15,000 hazards
annually with the new program.<br>
This proves that predictive analytics can help in significantly reducing incidents. Adopting this
approach can be beneficial to the maritime industry because the industry has an immense focus
on safety. Capturing the human factor element for predictive analysis helps in making informed
decisions. For example, if a worker, who is usually alert in his work every day, falls sick or is
disoriented someday, his behavior and activities might be little different from normal days. The
safety team can observe his behavior through inputs from other employees or predictive software
to take preventive measures.</p>

<p><strong>Predictive models</strong><br><br>
A detailed analysis of the human factor helps in identifying the strongest driver for a particular
outcome. These drivers help in making predictive models for practical recommendations and
future interventions. A few predictive models based on work pressure, fatigue, job security, sleep
problems, and so on are discussed below.<br><br>

<strong>Predicting Safety Culture</strong><br><br>

Studies show that when organizations value safety and welfare over operational charge,
operation schedule, and loss of goods and ship, safety culture is expected to be more mature.
Interventions that advance crew strength and safety-focused leadership of supervisors are liable
to deliver optimistic effects for safety culture on board ships.<br>

Predicting Seafarers’ Psychological Wellbeing<br>
The psychological wellbeing of a seafarer is reduced by work-related pressures, fatigue, and
sleep problems. It reduces psychological feeling and functioning. On the other hand, a good
social environment where there is a high level of trust in co-workers, supervisors are highly
focused about their team’s safety, and supervisors encourage new ways of thinking about safety
result in improved psychological wellbeing of seafarers.<br>


<strong>Predicting Symptoms of Mental Ill Health</strong><br>

The symptoms of mental ill health (e.g., depression and anxiety) can be a result of high vigilance
demands at work along with sleep problems and chronic fatigue. Therefore, the impact of
vigilance demands and other work structures require consideration, especially when there is a
tendency to consider deep-sea sailing periods as opportunities for recovery.<br>

Predicting Sleep Problems

At times the increased work pressure results in sleep problems. This can be reduced by job
security and a supervisor’s safety leadership. The supervisors that are alert and guide safe
behaviors can lessen the probability of sleep problems with a better dedication to work and rest
requirements.<br>

<strong>Predicting Acute Fatigue</strong><br>

It is possible for seafarers not to feel fatigued either at the end of a duty period or workday when<br>
• they have the authority to use personal judgment in carrying out work<br>
• their immediate supervisors’ top priority is their team’s safety<br>
• seafarers have faith in their supervisors to look after their safety<br>
• their job security has high levels<br>
• they are not assigned work in environments that present difficulties such as small
workspace, dirty working environment, hazardous equipment, and material<br><br>


<strong>Predicting Chronic Fatigue</strong><br>

Work pressure, impaired recovery, lack of job security, and acute fatigue also help in assessing
the risk of seafarers developing chronic fatigue. Focused attention must be given in this case for
effective recovery during work periods.<br><br>

<strong>Predicting Seafarers’ Need for Recovery</strong><br>

When constantly faced with operational uncertainty and tasked with maintaining high levels of
vigilance, seafarers are more likely to feel that they lack sufficient recovery between duty
periods. Job security, co-worker support, and safety leadership help in the better recovery of
seafarers. In addition, it seems that seafarers whose supervisors handle the team to detect unsafe
actions are more likely to get rest between duty periods, possibly because of increased devotion
to rest and work guidelines and schedules.<br>
Any decision by shipmasters and officers determine the fate of people, ships, and their
environment during their careers and incorrect decisions can lead to accidents. Therefore, it is
very important to analyze the causes of accidents and capture the data on the human factor for
taking safety measures.</p>
