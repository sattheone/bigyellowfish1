  <h2>Game-Based learning in Maritime Industry</h2>
</div>
  <div class="col-md-7">
    <br><br>
    <p>When protein-folding game Foldit unraveled the crystal structure of Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (M-
PMV) retroviral protease, it proved that games can solve real-world problems; they are not just for
entertainment and recreation activities. However, it is not that a game was never used for
something more than entertainment. For centuries games have been serving as a medium for
learning. For example, chess, a strategic game, was used to teach strategic thinking during the
Middle Ages, and Kreigsspiel was invented in 1812 specifically to teach war strategy to Prussian
officers. The core idea behind those game-based learning (GBL) techniques was to educate through
failure, repetition, and achievement of goals.
Almost in every game, the same concept is applied. A player starts off slow and gains skills until
they’re able to skillfully navigate the most difficult levels. GBL applies this very concept while
teaching a curriculum. Students work on a goal, taking actions and facing the consequences of their
actions. That way, they actively understand and exercise the correct way of doing things. This acts as
an active learning instead of passive learning.</p>

<p><strong>Impact of GBL</strong></p>
<p>
The regulators and shipping welfares try to create a more environmentally friendly, safe, and secure
maritime transportation sector. Despite their efforts, human error is still the principal cause of
shipping accidents. A study suggests that human error is responsible for 80% to 90% of all shipping
accidents. There have been instances when a little bit of negligence led to great casualties. GBL can
help reduce the number of casualties because it is a powerful educational model.</p>

<p><strong>Popular examples of GBL</strong></p>
<p>Singapore’s International Logistics &amp; Supply Chain Management (ILSCM) has designed a game called
the Shipping Company Game. The game allows students to learn about shipper/cargo pre-requisites,
and how to collaborate between different business functions in a shipping line, and to understand
the business and operations processes and limitations. Besides allowing the students to apply their
domain knowledge, such as freight, and fleet planning, sailing schedule to compete for business, the
game also enhances the students’ analytical and critical thinking, collaboration, communication,
and decision-making skills.
The Maritime industry can benefit from such games in many ways. Games like VSTEP’s RescueSim
allow emergency crews to virtually experience real-life situations. The game lets the crew assess a
situation and come up with a response strategy. When they implement it, they can see the
consequences of their responses. MYMIC’s NAUTIS is a game that provides a range of simulations for
the maritime industry such as communications, radar, ship handling, GMDSS, and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Game based learning</strong></p>
<p>The idea behind using computer games for education is to blend learning activities in a game. It’s not
just a model inspired by educators and researchers but is also a part of leading game designers’
description. As game designer Chris Crawford says, “The fundamental motivation for all game-
playing is to learn”. The important aspect to consider is how to integrate, and not just add, games to
the existing educational toolset. GBL can be better understood by considering the example of bridge
simulators. In those games, a trainee needs to perform a set of navigational tasks.
Now in that game, let a trainee achieve a certain level of competency in each game level before he
can move to the next level. Record his or her score and the number of attempts they took to pass

each level. When these records are posted on a global site where all trainees can view them, it
allows trainees to compete with each other. The outcome is thus, much more helpful than sitting
through lectures and theory.</p>

<p><strong>Games are not simulations</strong></p>

<p>Educational games are often confused with a simulated environment where a player can examine his
knowledge and skills. In fact, simulation is a pretty different learning module than games and it is a
commonly used tool in the maritime industry. Their similarities and differences are best captured by
Coleman’s term simulation games. It describes how goals apply to the possible actions in the
simulation. A strong investment of strong feelings is necessary for the game as the goals are tied to
conflict. Even if the game doesn’t have specific conflicts and goals, most players will plan their goals,
and use the simulation to achieve those goals. Moreover, in simulations, the level of the model has
high priority. But a computer game will often sacrifice naturalism if it furthers the overall game
experience. Computer games are not only mainly about simulating; rather they provide an
interesting experience meeting specific goals.
GBL is a promising and emerging technology, which is very beneficial for the educational needs of
the maritime industry. It can support the acquisition of facts through drill and practice, and of
process skills through simulation. The maritime industry can use it as a supplementary tool to teach
active and critical learning.</p>
